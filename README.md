# Ascent-Simulation Overview

The "ascent_simulation.m" program will predict the net lifting force of helium required to achieve a vertical target ascent rate for a certain payload. 

# Ascent-Simulation Description

In the simplest terms, the simulation iterates over helium mass and calculates the position, velocity, and acceleration in the vertical direction using a force balance. 

The force balance takes into account varying buoyant force and gravitational force with altitude. These forces are dependent on varying air temperature, air pressure, air density, balloon cross-sectional area, balloon volume, drag force, and gravitational acceleration with altitude. Each varying parameter has its own user defined function to calculate the changes with respect to altitude. The air temperature, air pressure, and air density functions were based on NASA's 1976 Standard Atmosphere. The balloon cross-sectional area, balloon volume, drag force, and gravitaional acceleration functions were derived using basic physics knowledge and some research. 

Something about how it iterates and finds the optimal values

The simulation outputs graphs, target net lifting force, predicted target ascent rate, blah blah blah
